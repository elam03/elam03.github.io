Starting with a cityscape
============

**5/15/2016**

I wanted to start with something familiar, something comfortable. So I set my first goal to create a cityscape scene.

I played with the examples on http://elm-lang.org/examples and saw many great examples on drawing some simple rectangles, doing things with mouse input, etc. Tweaking with small, working examples was a really awesome. They really helped with learning the syntax through a more experimental process.
