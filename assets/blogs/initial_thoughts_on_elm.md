Hi there. I'd like to share my thoughts on elm! â˜º

What's my motivation to learn elm? It's a totally new programming experience for me! Elm is a learning experience on several fronts.

My background is more device/system level C++ programming. I haven't had much professional experience with html/javascript, nor have I ever used any other functional programming language.

One of my other goals is to document my elm learning experience. My background affords me a different perspective and I hope that people with similar backgrounds as me will have an additional resource to learn from.
